# Baby Time: Android Wear Lock

An app to prevent rugrats from accidentally SMSing China or ordering you a Lyft car when you’re
holding them. It keeps the screen on, but at its lowest brightness setting to avoid annoying – or
worse yet, interesting – an infant.

-----------

Start the app by saying "OK Google, run Baby Time." The only way to exit Baby Time is to swipe up
twice and then down twice:

Any other types of touches will keep the watch locked and just show a message:

# Getting the app

To run the app, install the release application from [Google Play]
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yonisamlan.wearbabytime) onto your phone, where
it will auto-install the included watch app onto your connected watch. For those inclined, you can
open the source and install the Wear app directly to your wearable.
